BlackJack, (also known as "21"), is an intuitive card game between a dealer and several players or only one player.

Rules of the game:

The dealer and player are both dealt 2 cards. The goal is to:
1. Get 21, or as close as possible to 21 without going over, called "busting".
2. If you go over 21, you lose. If dealer goes over 21, they lose. 
3. If neither of you goes over 21, the one with the higher score wins.

    1. Hit: dealer will dealt you another card
    2. Stay: dealer will stop dealing you any cards, and begin dealing cards to himself until he either reaches the highest score to 21, or goes over 21.
    3. Doubledowm: dealer will hand you only 1 more card and your bet amount doubles, smart move to move if you are confident that the next card will bring you to 21 or close. But, if your next card doesn't bring you anywhere near 21, then oops! You lose double the original bet amount.
3. Score: if the dealer loses, you win your bet amount and it's added to your chip stack. If you lose, you lose the amount of your best.
